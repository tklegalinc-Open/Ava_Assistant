# Priority Framework
*Countering shiny object syndrome since 2026*

---

## The Problem

Tommy has 10+ ventures, limited time, and the brain of a strategist who sees opportunity everywhere. Every shiny object looks like it could be the big one.

**The cost:** Diluted focus, slow progress on things that matter, energy spent on things that don't.

---

## The Framework

### Before Starting Anything New, Ask:

**1. Does this serve a Tier 1 priority?**
- TK Legal (cash flow)
- Nualtis (current role, income)
- TKYM Excavation (2026 revenue goal)

If no → it's probably a distraction.

**2. What's the realistic time investment?**
- Hours this week?
- Ongoing commitment?
- Is this a one-time task or a new open loop?

**3. What am I NOT doing if I do this?**
Every yes is a no to something else. Name it.

**4. Can this wait 90 days?**
If it's still exciting in 90 days, it's probably real. If not, you dodged a bullet.

**5. What's the minimum viable test?**
Can you validate with 4 hours instead of 40? Do that first.

## The "Not Now" List

Ideas that are valid but explicitly deprioritized:

1. *Add items here as they get triaged*

---

## Weekly Priority Review

Every Sunday (before content session):
1. Review this document
2. Confirm top 3 priorities for the week
3. Move anything that crept in back to Someday/Maybe
4. Ask: "What would make this week a win?"

---

## Decision Template

When a new opportunity appears:

```
OPPORTUNITY: [Name]

Tier 1 priority? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Time required: _____ hours
Opportunity cost: Instead of ____________
Can wait 90 days? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Minimum viable test: ____________

DECISION: [ ] Do now [ ] Schedule [ ] Someday/Maybe [ ] Pass
```

## Ava's Role

I'm here to:
- Ask "Does this serve a Tier 1 priority?" when you're excited about something
- Offer multiple choice when decisions are fuzzy
- Remind you of the Not Now list
- Celebrate focus, not just activity

You gave me permission to challenge you. I will.
