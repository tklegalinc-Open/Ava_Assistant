## Overview

**Current positioning:** Fractional General Counsel for pharma/life sciences/biotech
**Headline:** "Strategic Legal Partnership for Innovation-Driven Industries"

---

## What's Working ✅

### Strong Positioning
- Clear niche: pharma, life sciences, biotech
- Fractional GC model is differentiated
- Montreal + bilingual angle is smart

### Good Social Proof
- "50+ Companies Served"
- "$50M+ Funding Raised"
- "8+ Years Experience"

### Clear Service Offerings
1. Fractional General Counsel ($5,000/mo starting)
2. Corporate Law
3. Intellectual Property
4. Fractional IP Director ($6,500/mo starting)

### Professional Presentation
- Clean design
- Multiple CTAs to contact
- Phone + email + online booking

---

## Opportunities for Improvement 🔧

### 1. No Testimonials or Case Studies
**Problem:** Claims are strong but unsubstantiated
**Fix:** Add 2-3 client testimonials (can be anonymized: "Leading Montreal biotech company...")

### 2. No Blog/Content
**Problem:** Missing SEO opportunity, no reason to return
**Fix:** Add legal tips blog, industry insights (ties into LinkedIn content strategy)

### 3. Limited Personal Brand
**Problem:** Tommy's personal credibility isn't front-and-center
**Fix:** Add "About Tommy Kenny" section with photo, credentials, story

### 4. No Lead Magnet
**Problem:** Only CTAs are "schedule consultation" — high commitment
**Fix:** Add downloadable resource (e.g., "Pharmaceutical Startup Legal Checklist") to capture emails

### 5. Meta Ads Landing Page
**Problem:** Current pages are comprehensive but long — not optimized for ads
**Fix:** Create dedicated landing page for Meta ads (single CTA, focused message)

## Quick Wins (This Week)

| Priority | Task | Effort | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Add 2-3 testimonials | Low | High |
| 2 | Add Tommy's photo + bio | Low | Medium |
| 3 | Create ads landing page | Medium | High |
| 4 | Add Google Analytics / Meta Pixel | Low | Critical |

## SEO Notes

**Good keywords present:**
- Fractional General Counsel Montreal
- Pharmaceutical law
- Life sciences legal
- IP lawyer Montreal

**Missing opportunities:**
- "Business lawyer Montreal"
- "Startup lawyer Quebec"
- "Contract lawyer for pharma"

---

## For Meta Ads Campaign

**Current site can work** but ideally we'd create a dedicated landing page:

**Proposed landing page structure:**
1. Headline: "Legal advice that actually understands pharma"
2. 3 bullet points of value
3. Testimonial
4. Single CTA: "Book a free 15-min call"
5. No navigation, no distractions
