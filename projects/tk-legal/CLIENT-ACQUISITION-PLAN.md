# TK Legal Client Acquisition Plan
*De-risking from Nualtis dependency*

**Goal:** Generate new clients through visibility, social media, referrals, and Meta ads
**Why it matters:** 90% revenue concentration = existential risk. Diversification is critical.

---

## Current State

- Primary client: Nualtis (90% of revenue)
- Practice areas: IP, commercial/business law, litigation
- Positioning: Pharma-savvy, BD-oriented, strategic counsel
- Location: Montreal (628 St Jacques pied-à-terre)

---

## Acquisition Channels

### 1. LinkedIn (Organic) — High Priority
**Why:** B2B legal services buyers are on LinkedIn. Tommy already has credibility.

**Strategy:**
- Post 3-5x/week (thought leadership, not sales)
- Content pillars: IP basics, commercial law tips, pharma industry insights, founder stories
- Engage in comments on target prospects' posts
- Connect with startup founders, pharma execs, business owners in Quebec/Canada

**Content examples:**
- "3 IP mistakes that kill pharma startups"
- "What to look for in a commercial contract (before you sign)"
- "Why your business lawyer should understand your industry"

**Investment:** Time (Sunday content sessions already planned)

---

### 2. Meta Ads — Medium Priority
**Why:** Can target business owners, founders, specific industries in Quebec

**Campaign Structure:**

#### Campaign A: Awareness
- **Objective:** Brand awareness / reach
- **Audience:** Business owners, founders, executives in Quebec
- **Creative:** Educational content, "Did you know?" legal tips
- **CTA:** Follow on LinkedIn, visit website
- **Budget:** $10-20/day test

#### Campaign B: Lead Generation
- **Objective:** Leads (form fills or messages)
- **Audience:** Warm (engaged with awareness content) + lookalikes
- **Creative:** Free consultation offer, specific pain point (contracts, IP, disputes)
- **CTA:** Book a call, download guide
- **Budget:** $20-30/day once awareness is warm

**Landing Page Needed:**
- Simple page: What TK Legal does, who it's for, credibility markers, CTA to book
- Can build with GHL or simple landing page tool

---

### 3. Referral System — High Priority
**Why:** Highest trust, lowest cost, best conversion

**Strategy:**
- Identify 20 people who could refer (accountants, other lawyers, business consultants, bankers)
- Personal outreach: coffee, call, or lunch
- Create a simple one-pager: "Who I help, how to refer"
- Consider referral incentive (where ethically permitted)

**Tracking:**
- Log all referral sources
- Thank referrers (handwritten note, gift)
- Report back on outcomes

---

### 4. Website / SEO — Lower Priority (for now)
**Why:** Slower to build, but compounds over time

**Quick wins:**
- Ensure Google Business Profile is claimed and optimized
- Basic SEO on key pages (IP lawyer Montreal, business lawyer Quebec)
- Add testimonials / case studies if available

**Defer:** Major website overhaul until other channels are producing
