## Video 1: The Contract Mistake

**Hook (first 2 sec):** "Signing a contract? Stop."

**Script:**
Most founders sign contracts without understanding what they're giving up.
I've seen companies lose IP rights, get locked into bad deals, and waive protections they didn't know they had.
One review. That's all it takes.
TK Legal — we catch what you miss.

Most growing companies need strategic legal leadership.
But a full-time GC costs $300K+ per year.
Our Fractional GC model gives you executive-level legal guidance — at a fraction of the cost.
Board meetings. Contract negotiations. Risk management. All covered.

## Video 4: The IP Warning

**Hook (first 2 sec):** "Your idea isn't protected."

**Script:**
You think your innovation is safe?
Without proper IP strategy, competitors can copy everything.
Patents. Trademarks. Trade secrets.
One missed filing, one weak clause, and years of R&D can walk out the door.
TK Legal — we protect what you've built.

Get it right from day one.
TK Legal — legal strategy for companies that plan to scale.

**Length:** 15 seconds
**CTA:** "Set up your legal foundation"

**Script:**
Automatic renewal clauses.
Unlimited liability.
IP assignment buried in the fine print.
Weak termination rights.
I've seen all of these sink deals — and companies.
Before you sign anything, get a second opinion.
TK Legal — we read the fine print so you don't have to.

**Visual direction:** Document with highlighted red flags, then professional review scene
**Length:** 18 seconds
**CTA:** "Get a contract review"

## Video 8: The Cost Myth

**Hook (first 2 sec):** "Think lawyers are too expensive?"
