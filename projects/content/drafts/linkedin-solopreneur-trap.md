# The Solopreneur Trap (And How I'm Escaping It)

I've been a lawyer for over a decade. I've also been a business owner, a consultant, and—if I'm honest—a professional plate spinner.

For years, I told myself the same story most solopreneurs tell: "I'll hire when the time is right. When there's more revenue. When I can afford to."

That time never came. Because I kept finding reasons to delay.

Here's what I've learned: **the solopreneur model doesn't scale. It just burns you out more efficiently.**

## The Trap

When you're good at what you do, people want more of you. That feels like success. But it's actually a trap.

Every hour you spend on execution is an hour you're not spending on:
- Strategy
- Business development
- Building systems that work without you

I built a law practice that depended entirely on me. Every client call, every brief, every decision—all funneled through one person. Me.

The revenue was good. The lifestyle wasn't.

## The Shift

This year, I'm doing something different. I'm treating my businesses like *businesses*, not personal practices.

That means:
1. **Building systems before I need them.** Documenting processes, creating templates, setting up workflows that don't require my constant input.

2. **Leveraging AI as a force multiplier.** Not to replace human judgment, but to handle the work that doesn't need it. Research, drafts, scheduling, analysis—anything that's important but not unique to me.

3. **Hiring for outcomes, not hours.** I don't need an employee who sits at a desk. I need people (and tools) that produce results.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

I recently set up an AI assistant that works while I sleep. Not as a gimmick—as a legitimate part of the operation.

It monitors my projects, builds out systems, drafts content, and flags opportunities I might miss. Every morning, I wake up to a brief: what happened, what's in progress, what I should focus on.

Is it perfect? No. But it's already doing work that I used to either do myself (poorly, at 11pm) or not do at all.

## The Mindset Change

The hardest part wasn't the technology. It was letting go of the idea that everything needs my personal touch.

Some things do. Client relationships. Strategic decisions. High-stakes negotiations.

But most things? Most things just need to get done. And they don't need *me* to do them.

---

## The Goal

I'm not trying to work less. I'm trying to work on the right things.

My goal for this year: build one company with $100M potential. Not by doing everything myself, but by building a machine that does most of it.

The solopreneur model got me here. But it won't get me where I'm going.

**What about you?** What's the one thing you're still doing yourself that you should have systematized months ago?
