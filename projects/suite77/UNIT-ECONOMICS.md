## Current Product Margins

Based on Tommy's numbers:

| Product | Cost | Retail Low | Retail High | Margin Low | Margin High |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Shirts | $30 | $100 | $240 | 70% | 87.5% |
| Pants | $10 | $100 | $200 | 90% | 95% |
| Ties | $4 | $50 | $50 | 92% | 92% |
| Suits | ~$150* | $600 | $900 | 75% | 83% |

*Suits noted as "150% of cost" — interpreting as $150 cost for ~$400-600 retail (need clarification)*

---

## Margin Analysis

### Strengths
- **Exceptional gross margins** — 70-95% is premium territory
- **Low inventory cost** for accessories (ties, add-ons)
- **Pants are a goldmine** — $10 cost, $100+ retail

### Considerations
- **Suits may need review** — the "150% of cost" note is unclear
- **Shirts are the anchor** — balance of quality perception and margin
- **Accessories drive profit** — upsell strategy critical

## Scenario Modeling

### Scenario A: Single Location, Steady State

**Assumptions:**
- Monthly foot traffic: 200 customers
- Conversion rate: 25%
- Average transaction: $300 (shirt + pants + tie)

**Monthly revenue:** 50 sales × $300 = **$15,000**
**Monthly COGS:** 50 × ~$44 = **$2,200**
**Gross profit:** **$12,800** (85% margin)

**Fixed costs to cover:**
- Rent (Old Montreal/Ville-Marie): $3,000-8,000/mo
- Salesperson: $3,000-4,000/mo (base + commission)
- Utilities, insurance, misc: $500-1,000/mo

**Net before owner draw:** $500-6,000/mo depending on rent

### Scenario B: High-Touch, Low-Volume

**Assumptions:**
- Target affluent clients, appointment-based
- 20 clients/month
- Average transaction: $800 (suit + shirts + accessories)

**Monthly revenue:** 20 × $800 = **$16,000**
**Monthly COGS:** ~$3,600
**Gross profit:** **$12,400**

---

## Break-Even Analysis

**Fixed costs estimate:** $6,000-12,000/mo (depending on location/staffing)

**Break-even units:**
- At $300 avg transaction, 85% margin: ~24-47 sales/month
- At $800 avg transaction, 77% margin: ~10-20 sales/month

---

## Strategic Questions

1. **Volume vs. Premium:** Low-volume/high-touch or higher-traffic model?
2. **Location:** Old Montreal (prestige, high rent) vs. emerging neighborhood (lower rent, different clientele)?
3. **Membership model:** How does recurring revenue change the math?
4. **Online component:** Add e-commerce or purely experiential in-store?

## Pricing Optimization Ideas

| Move | Impact | Risk |
|------|--------|------|
| Raise shirt floor to $120 | +$20/shirt, still competitive | Minimal |
| Bundle pricing (suit + 2 shirts + tie = $1,000) | Higher avg transaction, perceived value | Complexity |
| Tiered pricing (good/better/best) | Anchoring, upsell path | Inventory complexity |
| Members-only pricing (10% off) | Loyalty, recurring relationship | Margin erosion |

## Next Steps to Validate

- [ ] Clarify suit cost structure (the 150% note)
- [ ] Define target customer profile precisely
- [ ] Scout 3 potential locations with rent comps
- [ ] Interview 2-3 potential salesperson candidates
- [ ] Test pricing with informal focus group (friends, network)
