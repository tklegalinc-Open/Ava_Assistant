## Night Owl Adaptation

Tommy is more productive later in the day but wants morning structure.

**Option A: Early-ish start (8-9 AM)**
- Full routine before work
- Protected morning, energized afternoon

**Option B: Compressed morning (9-10 AM)**
- Shorter spa, faster transitions
- Gym can move to evening if needed

**The key:** Don't skip steps, just compress them. The sequence matters more than the duration.
